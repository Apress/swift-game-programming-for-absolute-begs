Update log
===========
5/4/2016: Update examples for Xcode 7.3. All usage of the double increment/decrement operator (++/—-) has been replaced by += and -=, since these operators will be gone in Swift 3. All for-loops now use ranges instead of the C-style syntax, also to comply with Swift 3. A few minor things were fixed with path references. 

1/8/2016: Fixed a few remaining global path references in the Tut’s Tomb game examples.

12/30/2015: Updated examples for Xcode 7.2. Fixed local path references in the PainterFinal example. Since the main bugs related to atlases have been solved in the new Xcode, I also updated the TickTick samples to remove the atlas workaround. As a result, the TickTick examples will now only work correctly on iOS 9.2 and newer. Made a change in the WaterDrop and Sound classes in TickTickFinal to avoid having to open too many files, which caused a crash.

10/23/2015: Fixed path references to be local in all projects.

09/11/2015: Updated examples for Xcode 7.1.

08/27/2015: Fixed error in Chapter 21.
